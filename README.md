# Knights Of The Ether: Blightfell

This document explains what the KOTE (Knights of the Ether) project is about.

## About

Knights Of The Ether: Blightfell is a Web3 deck-building roguelike game. It draws inspiration from unlimited replayability and a deep focus on strategy-driven competitive gameplay. The game acts as a bridge from Web2 to Web3, having been developed from scratch with blockchain technology. This allows players to truly own their characters and in-game assets through the use of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Blightfell serves as the foundational layer for an ever-expanding Fantasy RPG, which other indie developers can further build upon.

## Gameplay

Players have a choice of 4,000 distinct Knights, each boasting its own unique style and in-game effects. If players grow weary of their initial Knight, they can head to the marketplace to sell its armor and purchase a new set. The game challenges players to strategize on how to upgrade each segment of their Knight to achieve the ultimate run.

## In-Game Ownership

The game emphasizes the concept of ownership. The character a player possesses is truly theirs, and the game developers cannot confiscate it. Players have the liberty to upgrade, sell, or trade their characters.
