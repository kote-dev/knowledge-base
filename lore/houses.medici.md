**Holy Texts**

Blood Orb. An undulating orb of Varen’s blood that levitates over the Warden’s well in the central church. Only the warden can read the messages in its vibrations and movements.

Books of Pain. These are texts with spiked gloves attached to the front and back covers that one must insert their hands into in order to open the book. The pain makes one especially receptive to the material inside the book and therefore is required to read them.
