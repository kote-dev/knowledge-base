# Cynthienne - Philosophy, Science and Poetry

**Deity of Choice - Zyndarial, the Outsider**

Scholarly based church

Scientific approach to faith and magic

The best thinkers are awarded positions of influence

Automatic writing as ritual

Focused on progress and knowledge acquisition

Church tied in with the state

**Church Structure**

Similar to a university. Students move up through grades and prove their abilities through scholarly pursuits.

They are highly organized and based around a melding of education, politics and faith.

Extremely competition oriented since only so many students are elevated from grade to grade each year.

**Relations With Other Faiths**

They see all faiths as valid sources of study and true in their own rights.

They exchange information with all of the others and study them in a friendly yet detached manner.

They believe that their approach is the most effective at learning more about interplanar beings and magic and that they are the most educated/progressive.

**Terminology**

_Students_ and _teachers_.

Hierarchy based on _grades_.

Schools of thought and practice separate out teachings into mind, body, soul, planes and deities.

Evokers are the most respected and feared practitioners.

**Rituals**

Automatic writing = Channel their patron deities thoughts into writing

Evoking = A rigorous ritual involving pulling an entity from their plane to ours. This is highly dangerous and only practiced by adepts. Mostly used for info-gathering purposes but can also be used nefariously. Only taught to the students of the highest grades at the tops of their classes.

**Sayings**

“Was it written?”

“Never the teacher. Always the student.”

“Know thine own ways.”

“The onus is upon us.”

“Envision, measure, draw.”

**Taboos**

Following intuition over logic.

Foolhardiness and not being thorough. “Little mistakes can kill.”

Not being competitive and ambitious.

**Clothes and Symbols**

Their version of school uniforms. Similar to british private school looks.

Everyone is dressed very cleanly and particularly.

Many hats, canes and other fanciful accoutrements that harken back to the late 1800’s.

The symbol is a writing compass drawing a circle

**Holy Texts**

The Prime Archives = Gargantuan underground library full of all of the important texts dating back to the beginning of House Cynthienne.

Cynthiennes take a quantity over quality approach to their holy texts but have a few central pieces that most works branch out from…

1. The Form of All Things by Cadmas Augustine

2. Hosts of the Planes: Deities and Their Functions by Byron Bloom

3. The Book of the Fallen by Anonymous

One book only evokers are allowed to read and is highly dangerous in the hands of the uninitiated is The Circle by Farus Sol
