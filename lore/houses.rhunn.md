# Rhunn - Cunning, Dreams and Games of Chance

**Deity of Choice - Chaya Reva**

Intuition based faith

Communal worship

Dream-readers

Rituals include casting lots, reading ‘dream cards’ and bonethrowing.

Church leaders voted on and are usually charismatic and cunning types.

**Church Structure**

Folk worship, communal shrines and outdoor churches.

No formal church hierarchy.

All able-bodied citizens enter a raffle once every 2 years to join the 100 member council that directs the affairs of the church. All have equal representation and come from a different section of the city.

Some decisions are left up to games of chance.

Council members are expected to do intensive ‘dreamwork’ in order to be as in tune with Chaya Reva as possible during their time on the council.

They believe that their dreams will show them the way to prosperity and ultimate knowledge.

**Relations With Other Faiths**

Rhunnites have no ill-will towards other faiths. They are very go-with-the-flow.

They disagree with some of the more barbaric rituals of the medici’s as well as the extreme asceticism of the Brightflame’s but they don’t seek to snuff them out.

**Terminology**

Wayfinders are shaman-like priests who advise people on the contents of their dreams.

The Gallery is the chamber where the council of chance resides.

House Dreamers are nobles who spend their days in trances in order to divine the path forward for their families. They believe the longer one is ‘asleep’ the more in-tune they are with Chaya Reva and the more she will guide their families in the waking hours.

**Rituals**

Dreamwalking aka Lucid Dreaming in order to communicate with Chaya Reva and the interplanar beings under her purview.

Bonethrowing is the casting of lots akin to throwing dice in order to divine secrets.

Blindfolded knife throwing is also popular amongst the lower classes. They set up a target covered with many symbols and divine meaning out of the ones that the knives end up in.

Teamdreaming are group trances in which many people dreamwalk communally.

**Sayings**

“If Chance Allows It.”

“May it be just as you dreamed”

“What say the bones?”

“The way is clear in this waking dream”

The eyes of Chaya never close”

**Taboos**

Not sharing your dreams with those closest to you

Getting angry at a game or bad luck… it’s always as Chaya wills it.

Foregoing sleep for work. They see sleep as a crucial aspect of one’s growth as a person, even more so than work.

Drinking hot liquids (idk why lol)

**Clothes and Symbols**

Lots of green!

No robes, but more martial arts style clothing.

Bags and pouches and pockets abound because people are always carrying around their good luck charms, bones for bonethrowing and game pieces such as cards and dice.

Clothing is usually understated but accessories are flashy.

Their symbol is a hand holding 5 cards.

**Holy Texts**

The Dreambook. A collective journal in the dream-world that all council members contribute to each night. Especially important and outlined are the dreams that council members have that come true.

“The Dreams of Chaya Reva” is a book of dream fables surrounding Chaya Reva’s life. Every worshiper owns one and sleeps with it near them. It is supposed to connect one closer to Chaya in sleep.
