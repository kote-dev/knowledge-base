# The World

4 royal houses operate in order to continue their tenuous hold over their respective people, their respective cities and the realm at large.

Magical subterfuge and very rarely, open non-magical warfare, have been the modus operandi for the past 2000 years of the dark ages.

The new infusion of magic into the realm from the portal has created a soft alliance between the 4 houses but only as a means to keep their hold on the magic and their place above the populace who now have access to magic they hadn’t had before.

## Knights as Industrialized Heroes

Born into servitude, knights are trained to uphold the iron grip of the royal houses. While not practitioners of magic themselves, they have always been taught its manners and methods in anticipation of an awakening… just like the realm is currently experiencing.

As ‘boots on the ground’ in the war to control the flow of magic, they are the houses' first response to explore and harness the power of the portal and the planes on the other side.

They see their position as just, as the houses bring some level of order and structure to a chaotic land. They are believers in the fact that hierarchy is necessary for a functioning society, but the separate houses all have differing methods for how to maintain that hierarchy.

Knights are born into their position and trained from the time they can walk by the respective orders of each house.
