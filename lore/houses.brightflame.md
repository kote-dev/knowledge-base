# Brightflame - Loyalty, Birth and Starlight

**Deity of Choice - The Changer**

Reclusive, true believer faith

Monk-like ascetism

Mostly solo worship and meditation

Most in-tune with the ancient ways and magic

No hierarchy

Not connected to the politics of their city

**Church Structure**

No hierarchy involved here and 0 integrations with the politics of their town.

Worship takes the form of mostly solitary meditations and pilgrimages as well as some collective meditations and rituals.

Believers who join the brotherhood rely on donations of food and clothing.

**Relations With Other Faiths**

These worshipers keep to themselves and don’t interfere with other churches. They expect to be left alone in return.

They see themselves as the keepers of the true faith just as it was meant to be practiced in the ancient times when magic still permeated the land.

**Terminology**

The monks are the _Illuminated_ and are committed to _expanding their inner star_.

They judge the goodness of things based off of their _brightness_ aka how well it reflects the primeval light of the ether.

**Rituals**

Levitation meditation

Starlight catching. Startalking.

Interplanar communication with beings of light.

Lightquilt weaving

**Sayings**

“The starlight in you burns bright today.”

“Light reaches us from any distance.”

“May your light never dim.” “May your star never extinguish.”

“In the beginning there was light.”

“May the stars guide your way”

“May your light guide you”

**Taboos**

Using lights or candles during nighttime. This goes against the natural order and blocks out light from the stars.

Speaking loudly or brashly. Cursing of any kind.

Refusing aid in any form to pregnant women or young children.

Inebriation other than church-sanctioned psychedelics.

**Clothes and Symbols**

Robes of all white with very finely done, almost imperceptible, ‘flame stitching’. Iridescent red stitches that accent their robes.

Adherents shave their heads to be closer to the light.

Their symbol is a star with 5 rays of light shining outwards.

**Holy Texts**

The Endless Scroll. A large scroll that unfurls forever and holds written knowledge from over 2000 years ago.

Highly skilled adherents are able to write light journals into the air that can then be imprinted onto parchment.

Map of the stars (a great star map of all the constellations and the different power they can provide)
