# The Economy

**How is currency produced?**

Fief coins are minted by the Great Sanctum, a shadowy group run by an anonymous faction untethered (supposedly) to any of the great houses.

Fief coins are meant to represent shares of fiefdoms throughout the realm but they no longer seem to be attached meaningfully to those parcels of land.

**Who determines the levers of the economy?**

Affiliates of the Great Sanctum do the bidding of The Few (the leaders of the Great Sanctum) and lend/collect all fief throughout the land.

Collections are harsh and always recouped for the sanctum. As they say, “A little debt helps, a lot of debt hurts… a lot.”

**Is the system rigged or fair?**

As rigged as most systems. The lack of oversight over the Great Sanctum allows for little pushback against any economic actions seen as predatory or benefitting those in charge.

The system doesn’t allow much upward mobility. The hierarchies are pretty rigid for class and the way the money circulates keeps these hierarchies in place.

**Affiliates**

Wear dark velvet robes. Very well put together.

Derogatory and ruthless in their judgements.

Emotionless and offered referred to as soulless by the populace.

Each wear an amulet around their neck that summons a fiend to protect against attackers and theft.

The mere presence of these amulets is usually enough to scare off almost anyone.
