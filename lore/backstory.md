# The Backstory

1. **Blightfell is Alive**

A portal has opened. Who dares to step through?

On the other side, a new frontier awaits. It promises a nearly limitless supply of wealth and innovation to its future occupants. Opportunity is abundant and competition is scarce. They say wealth drops out of the air and into the purse of any who are present in this mythical land. There's only one problem... the wilds still need to be tamed and a Blight is spreading across the realm.

Initial scouting parties revealed barbarian hordes roaming the hillsides. They told tales of monstrous fiends skulking in the shadows; of dragons the size of mountains lying in wait atop hoards of gold, deep within labyrinthine caverns of their own making, roused at the slightest encroachment upon their land. At first, only a handful returned to describe the horrors. Those few who did, swore never to set foot in Blightfell again.

Regardless of their warnings, after a time, other well-equipped scouts were sent off to discover what they could. They were well-funded by the royal houses, but not well-funded enough. Some, however, possessed the luck and fortitude to make it back with mind, body and soul intact. Although bloodied and disheartened, they returned decked in gold and polished stones of every hue. The word spread quickly across the land.

Blightfell is open and its riches could be taken.

2. **The Decision**

The discovery of Blightfell and its untapped resources prompted lengthy deliberations among the representatives of the royal houses. Knights of renown from across the land rode north to Castle Ether to have their voices heard. Would the knightly court venture from their home of relative comfort to seek riches and glory in the new land? Were they willing to risk their way of life for the great unknown?

There was no easy answer.

But during these debates, day after day, the knights of the Council of Ether began to realize the truth... That their existence would soon come to an end if they simply did nothing. Already their armor grows brittle and their granary shrinks by the season. Although the kingdom they inhabited had much to offer, its time has passed. Its patrons have been greedy. The ripest fruits have been plucked. Everything that remains will soon be eaten or left to rot on the ground where it lies.

Most important of all, the spirit of the Knight is one of adventure and exploration. To wile the day away with only leisurely talk and tales of yesteryear is akin to a slow, dishonorable death. So late one evening, as the debate was coming to a head, the knights stared at one another around their table. They did not like what they saw. As the full moon shone down through the skylight, glinting off the hilts of well-polished swords that had not seen a day in battle for far too long, a vote was proposed. The Knights went around the table one by one and gave their answer.

It was unanimous

The Portal was beckoning and the Knights of the Ether would answer its call.

3. **The Preparations**

Word traveled from village to village, through dense forest, over mountain peaks and far along the River Discord. It was whispered by children, debated on by tradesman and songs were written and performed by traveling bards. Every able-bodied warrior in the realm was soon packing their bags, summoning their loyal squires and saddling their horse to join their brethren at Castle Ether in the northlands.

Forges that had not been lit in more than a decade suddenly roared to life. Armorers, the best at their craft, were called from far and wide to outfit the four companies from the four royal houses that would be venturing into the metaverse. Leatherworkers tanned and worked a hundred hides a day. Makeshift camps seemingly sprung up overnight in the land surrounding Castle Ether.

Knights were put to work sourcing whatever material could be found. The craftsmen worked tirelessly, day and night, their tools hammering incessantly away as slowly but surely the needs of the knights were met. Soon, before the countries eyes, the bravest warriors in the land were outfitted head to toe in silver, gold, steel and leather as fine as could be made.

As the knights waited for the word from on high, that they could step through the portal for the first time and meet whatever challenge await them there, they conversed with one another, sharing where they came from and what had moved them to join such a dangerous journey...
